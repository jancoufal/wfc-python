* [kTinker - grid with images](https://learnbyexample.github.io/practice_python_projects/square_tic_tac_toe/grid_and_images.html)

Troubleshooting
===
When the code fails with `import _tkinter # If this fails your Python may not be configured for Tk`
you can fix it on macos with `$ brew install python-tk`
See [stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5459444/tkinter-python-may-not-be-configured-for-tk).
